# tut
The King of Python project tools

Tut is a tool that makes python project management easier.

Instead of worrying about which set of tools you're using on your project, tut
abstracts them away. Whether your project uses git, pipenv, docker, pytest and
python 3.6, or mercurial, requirements.txt, virtualenv and nose on python 2.7, a
you would create a project with `tut new <folder>`, run your tests with `tut
test`, and install and manage your dependencies with `tut install <dep>` or `tut
update <dep>`.
